{
   A script to measure statistics on batch of images and write them to a file.
}

\description

   \image BatchStatistics.png

   The BatchStatistics script enables measurement of statistics on a batch of images. Results are output to the console and/or a text file in a variety of delimited formats such as CSV, suitable for import to spreadsheets and other external data analysis tools. All statistics and measures in the \tref Statistics {Statistics} process and \sref NoiseEvaluation {NoiseEvaluation} script are available for output.

   Batchstatistics supports multi-image file formats and any number of channels per image.

   \subsection { \label images_to_analyse Images to Analyse }
   {
      \list
      {
         {
            Click the \s {Add} button to choose image files to analyse.  Any image file format supported by PixInsight should be suitable.  The script will support images with multiple channels (RGB, etc.) and it should also support multi-image file formats such as FITS.  (Please note that his latter feature is untested by me so please report any problems via this thread).

            Note that the dialog can be resized vertically to show more list entries and horizontally to show long file names by dragging its edges as required.

            \vs \e { \s {Important:} When working with multi-channel images, it is best to try to work with sets of images that have the same number of channels and in the same order. BatchStatistics will process images with any number of channels, but will warn you via the PixInsight console if the current image contains a different number of channels than the previous one. Given that the objective is to output to a file format containing columns of data, changing the number of channels between images will mean that the column headers do not always correspond to the data rows.  (Note that if you append results to an existing output file, BatchStatistics has no way to know how many columns of data it contains, so the operator is responsible for doing the right thing!)}

            \vs BatchStatistics does not currently support working with open image views, previews, etc. \vs
         }
         {
            The \s {Clear}, \s {Invert Selection} and \s {Remove Selected} buttons function in the same manner as other PixInsight scripts and processes should you need to amend the list.
         }
      }
   }

   \subsection { \label statistics_options Statistics Options }
   {
      \list
      {
         {
            The \s {Number Format} combo box functions in the same manner as the existing \tref Statistics {Statistics} process.  You may output results using PixInsight's native Normalized Real format, or converted to Integer bit depth to match your camera's output format (typically 16 bit for CCD cameras or 12 / 14 bit for DSLR cameras).
         }
         {
            The \s {Precision} spin box allows you to choose the number of digits in Normalized Real and Scientific formats between 0 and 17 places.
         }
         {
            The \s {Scientific Notation} check box functions in the same manner as the existing \tref Statistics {Statistics} process.  It allows you to output Normalized Real format numbers in scientific notation.
         }
         {
            The \s {Normalize} check box functions in the same manner as the existing \tref Statistics {Statistics} process.  It makes all scale estimates consistent with the standard deviation of a normal distribution.
         }
         {
            The \s {Unclipped} check box functions in the same manner as the existing \tref Statistics {Statistics} process. By default, statistics are computed by clipping (ignoring) pixels with values of 0 ("black") and 1 (fully saturated) when this box is unchecked.  If you change the \s {Clipping Low} and \s {Clipping High} controls, then pixels with values outside the chosen clipping range will be ignored instead.  By checking the \s {Unclipped} check box, statistics are computed for all pixels in the image ignoring any clipping range.
         }
         {
            \s {Clipping Low} and \s {Clipping High}: If the \s {Unclipped} check box is unchecked, any pixels with values less than \s {Clipping Low} or greater than \s {Clipping High} will be excluded from statistics calculations.
         }
      }
   }

         {
            Select the appropriate check boxes to choose which statistics to output.  Except as noted below, all options should function in the same manner as the existing \tref Statistics {Statistics} process.

            \vs \e { \s {Important: Selecting all statistics may lead to long pauses between images.  The script may appear to have hung but be patient as some options (such as Qn) are computationally expensive and may take some time to complete.  The status bar and console messages will only update once all channels in an image have been fully processed.} }
